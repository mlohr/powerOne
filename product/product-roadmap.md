# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. OKR Hierarchy
Create, edit, and manage Objectives and Key Results across all organizational levels (Group → Entity → Domain → Department → Team) with clear ownership, cascade linking with clickable navigation, lifecycle management, metric definition for Key Results (1-3 metrics per KR with scale, baseline, and target), searchable filter dropdowns, pre-set filters (My OKRs, My Entity, My Domain), custom saved filters, and three view modes (full, compact, hierarchy) with visual tree structure showing indentation and connector lines for cascade relationships. Includes dynamic breadcrumb switching between organizational and OKR cascade navigation.

### 2. Programs
Create and manage cross-entity strategic initiatives with program leads, assign them to Objectives, and visualize rolled-up progress.

### 3. Metrics & Progress
Update metric values during sprints, track progress with real-time visualization and historical trends across all levels.

### 4. OKR Rituals
Create and facilitate planning sessions, check-ins, reviews, and retrospectives linked to relevant Objectives and Key Results.
