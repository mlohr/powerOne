# PowerOne

## Description
PowerOne is an outcome-driven OKR management tool that connects strategy to execution across distributed organizations. It enables everyone—from leadership to individual contributors across multiple entities, countries, and teams—to clearly understand what matters, why it matters, who owns it, how it's being executed, and how progress is tracking. PowerOne makes Programs, ownership, tasks, and progress transparent at all times through an intuitive interface that requires minimal OKR expertise.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Lack of Shared Clarity Across Entities and Levels
PowerOne provides a clear OKR hierarchy (Group → Entity → Domain → Department → Team) where lower-level OKRs link to higher-level Key Results, making ownership and relationships visible at all times.

### Problem 2: Missing Structure Between Strategy and Execution
PowerOne introduces Programs as first-class entities with clear leads and accountability, showing how cross-entity strategic initiatives connect to Objectives and roll up progress.

### Problem 3: OKRs Are Hard to Understand for Non-Experts
PowerOne uses extremely intuitive UX/UI with plain-language structure and visual hierarchy, requiring minimal OKR training while providing at-a-glance answers.

### Problem 4: Objectives Focus on Activities, Not Outcomes
PowerOne explicitly frames Objectives as outcome statements and reinforces the distinction between outcomes (Objectives), measures (Key Results), and actions (Tasks).

### Problem 5: Key Results Are Confused With Tasks
PowerOne enforces metric-driven Key Results with 1-3 metrics each, defined scales, baselines, and targets—showing progress as movement toward outcomes, not task completion.

### Problem 6: Missing Bridge Between Strategy and Daily Work
PowerOne allows concrete Tasks to be assigned to Key Results, each with a description, owner, and status (open/completed), making it clear what work drives metric progress without polluting the OKR structure.

### Problem 7: Progress Tracking Is Fragmented and Hard to Trust
PowerOne enables consistent metric updates during sprints with transparent visualization across Key Results, Objectives, and Programs.
